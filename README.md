## Overview

I developed the Chatbase Widget GTM Template to provide an easy way for setting up and managing Chatbase chat widgets through Google Tag Manager. With this template, I enable you to configure widget parameters, such as `chatbotId` and `domain`, and install the necessary script to render the widget on your site.

## Usage

1. Create a new tag in GTM.
2. Select the Chatbase tag you just installed.
3. Configure the required fields:
   - **Chatbot ID**: The unique identifier for your Chatbase chatbot.
   - **Domain**: The domain associated with your Chatbase configuration.
4. Set up the trigger(s) that will activate the tag, such as on page load.
5. Save your tag configuration and publish the changes in GTM.

## Support

If you encounter issues or have questions regarding the integration, feel free to open an issue in this repository, and I will help address your concerns.
